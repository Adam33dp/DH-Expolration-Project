**_European Immigration to North America 1865_**

For my project I decided to look at some of the stats for immigration into North America in 1865. I started with a timeline of 1865-1883 but that came up with far too much data so I narrowed it down to just the one year. Which came up with around data for around 300 people which was much easier for this project. I looked into where they came from and where they went in North America. I also researched into many reasons that people decided to come to America as well, turns out there are many reasons besides just simple curiosity.

**_The Irish_**
The data I found shows that many of the immigrants came from Ireland almost half actually. I found that there were a lot of reasons that people decided to leave their home country of Ireland in hopes of a new life. One of the largest crops in Ireland at the time was potatoes and due to horribly wet weather those crops did not grow between 1845-48 and than in 47-49 their grain yields suffered as well. All of this caused a death rate of approximately one in eight so many much of the countries residents decided to immigrate elsewhere starting with England and moving across to North America. By 1900 the population of Ireland dropped by thirty percent.(Doan,1999 page 13).

**_The English_**
The second largest amount of immigration appeared to come from England so I decided to do some research as to what was going on in the United Kingdom around this time that would make them want to take the trip. There were many different reasons that the English people wanted to immigrate to the new world. One of the most popular reasons was that people who had been servants in the country were finishing up their contracts and now out on the street without land to their name. Travelling across the Atlantic could mean  they  would own their own land and build a family(Lemay, 2013 page 74). The poverty rate was rising and many chose to go to America in search of jobs, land and possibility. As this time was known as the time of exploration many were willing to take the risk across the ocean in search of new lives and in search of new beginnings.

**_The Germans_**
Although many Germans at the time were very patriotic towards their country, it did make it harder for many of them to leave but certainly did not completely stop them. As at this time emigration from the country was also rather high. During the nineteenth century Germany although was in a state of economic growth with new industries and factories being created. There were still a lot of restrictions put on the average German citizen, when they looked towards North America they saw a certain level of freedom to be who they wanted to without judgement. Many German citizens saw sought to leave in order to have political asylum, freedom of religion and social security( Wagner, 2006 page 79)

**_The Scottish_**
The Scottish have a very long history of emigration which became even more common especially to Canada in the nineteenth century. When the Scottish emigrated they often relied on chains which was the aspect of going to a country that already had Scottish settlers their prior to them. This was due to their cultural importance, clanship and to ease the communication barrier between Scotland and Canada (Taylor, 2016 page 30). Unlike many other countries Scotland did not emigrate to the same extent as others and only really started in the nineteenth century, but at this time they did in large numbers.


**_The Swiss_**
There were not many Swiss immigrants in comparison to other Europeans. And the Swiss were not like many other immigrants of the time, when they came to Canada and the U.S they did not engage with other immigrants. In fact they often created their nationally viewed societies, they created their own associations (Schelbert, 2004 page 6). As well they would come to America to make money and than go back to Switzerland to support their elders or marry and settle down. Unlike many other immigrant who would come to settle in North America. The Swiss immigrants were known to essentially be an outcast compared to other immigrants as they did not have the same view of North America that the rest of the Europeans had.
